##Interview between a CTO and a new graduate developer (A parody in one part...)

_With huge apologies to Robert Calvert and the Lockheed Aircraft Corporation_


CTO: So. You want to be a developer.

Developer: A microservice developer

CTO: And why particularly microservices?

Developer: Because sir, I am in love with this technology. These magnificent engines of cloud and data.

CTO: That's very poetic.  Please continue.

Developer: This digital Delilah. Its cloud deployments and storage engines. Its monitoring outputs, the ever changing technicolour graphs and tumbling digits. 
The illustrious uniform of the digerati. The click of mice, the bagginess of the hoody, the faded conference T-shirt and the ever changing agile requirements.

CTO: I think that's enough.

Developer: But sir, the danger, and the glory of failure. A young and dashing career gone up in flames. Overpaid contractors laughing. To fail for one’s project.  To 
set forth with a silver MacBook Pro to joust with the forces of product ownership.

CTO: Projects don’t always fail you know.

Developer: It would be an honour to fail in such a project.

CTO: To be demotivated and deskilled ?

Developer: To be hideously burnt out and beyond the recognition of one’s own graduation class.

CTO: ... is that a Cobol T-Shirt  you’re wearing ?

Developer: No Sir.

CTO: Are you sure that's not a Cobol T-Shirt ?

Developer: Cobol sir ?

CTO: Cobol. Cobol. You know what Cobol is. It’s what mainframe developers use.

Developer: Not all mainframe developers use Cobol sir.

CTO: Well what’s that diagram that looks like a punched card? Is that a picture clause?

Developer: All right.  I can see it's no good lying to you.  I confess.  It is Cobol.  Only a little bit.

CTO: What on earth for?

Developer: It's for my mother sir.

CTO: Your mother?

Developer: You see my mother was the first woman to port an application to a [VAX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VAX).

CTO: A VAX ?

Developer: An idea of my father’s invention. You see he was too much of a professional sysadmin to actually do the coding himself, so my mother took it, and tried to port it singlehanded from the mainframe.

CTO: What happened?

Developer: It … crashed. The mounted [disk pack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disk_pack) was spun down and the code was never seen again. They found only her 132 column fanfold by her [DEC Writer](http://www.johnmiranda.com/dec.htm). And so, 
you see, ever since I have worn this T-shirt in her sacred memory.

CTO: I see.

Developer: Well sir. Do I get a VM?

CTO: In view of the confession you have just made, which must have taken a great deal of 
courage, I consider you an ideal type for the job.  There's a VM waiting for you in our cloud. 

CTO: A DevOp will give you a readme.md on the way out.  Start Monday. Oh, and by the way, 

Developer: Sir?

CTO: Don't let the CEO catch you wearing that T-shirt.  At least not in office hours, you 
understand.

Developer: But sir...

CTO: Alright then.  But keep it covered is that clear?

Developer: I understand sir.

CTO: Right Oh,

Developer: Righty Oh sir.
